            <h2 class="sub-title1">Experience</h2>
            <p>During my internship I worked within the Creative department, which is a small group composed of graphic designers, photographers, and filmmakers, and also collaborated often with others in brand, operations, logistics, and business development. As the Visual Design Intern, I was responsible for applying my knowledge of colour, typography, and imagery to further enhance the details of luxury branding in a variety of media and forms. For TEALEAVES’ designers, it’s important to have a deep understanding of how each detail influences how the product is perceived with brand communication as the final goal.  I’ve had the opportunity to work on a diverse range of projects from product packaging to email newsletter marketing to motion graphics.</p>
            <p>My main work as the Visual Design Intern included creating graphics for the website and email marketing, social media posts, and promotional assets for various marketing campaigns. In addition, I also assisted with packaging projects, including the redesign of the loose leaf retail tins and the new label layouts, and worked on the design of the new Shopify webstore.</p>

            <h2>Language of Aroma promotional assets</h2>
            <p>Produced a variety of assets, including motion graphics, data visualizations, and other digital marketing, for the Language of Aroma brand campaign and the Language of Aroma: Designing for Inclusivity panel presentation at <a href="https://schedule.sxsw.com/2019/events/PP88552" target="_blank" class="intext-link">SXSW 2019</a>.</p>
