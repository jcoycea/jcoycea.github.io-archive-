            <h3 class="sub-title2">Journey Framework</h3>
            <p>We created a journey map outlining the experience of interacting with an insurance company: from the awareness that one needs insurance to the ongoing stage of retention.</p>
            <br>
            <h3 class="sub-title2">Area of Intervention</h3>
            <p>I suggested that we pinpoint our area of intervention to be in the post-incident and claims process phases, as this would present an opportunity for the company to create an experiential process that can meet and exceed the customer’s expectations.</p>

          <div class="project-content col-8-12">
            <h3 class="sub-title2">Target Audience</h3>
            <p>We decided to target adults between the ages 25 to 40. In Canada, once young adults reach the age of 25, they are no longer covered under their parent’s insurance benefits. Up to the age of 40, individuals are more likely to embrace technology if it can add convenience to their lives. The company can create a positive experience specifically for this target audience that will then turn into a sustained relationship throughout the customer’s lifetime.</p>
            <br>
            <h3 class="sub-title2">User Testing</h3>
            <p>In order to gain perspective on how insurance apps were not meeting user needs we conducted research to make our solution more human-centric. My team was fortunate to be able to test our early prototypes in two rounds: our first user testing round helped us to validate our knowledge of the insurance process and make sure all the necessary content was present, and our second round was immensely useful for gathering insights on user needs from an emotional aspect. We conducted think-aloud tests and product-walkthroughs with six adults above the age of 25 and under 40, and all of whom has had prior experience with making claims with insurance companies.</p>
            <br>
            <h3 class="sub-title2">Value Proposition</h3>
            <p>We wanted to leverage the company’s existing brand values of being reliable and forward-thinking without transforming them into an insurtech company. This increases the viability of our proposed solution because the company's core business identity is not altered. Achieving customer value across the pyramid improves the digital experience which would create value for the company not only because it creates loyalty, but also it improves how customers see the brand.</p>

            <p>With our app, we aimed to redefine a customer’s experience with an insurance company, by reducing frictions and cognitive overhead to create a positive experience. We designed the solution to have some visual elements that were consistent with the company’s existing brand guidelines, but also introduced some bespoke style elements that would reframe the company as more approachable and friendly.</p>

            <h3 class="sub-title2">Prototype + Interactions</h3>
            <p>I played a key role in the creation of the user interface, interaction design, as well as the digital prototype. Prior to this project, I was still in the early stages of learning how to use Sketch and Flinto, so it was during my role creating multiple mockups that I pushed myself and developed my strength in prototyping.</p>
            <p>My team collaborated to produce wireframes based off of our research and insights. When first creating wireframes, we looked at other insurance and healthcare apps and how they contextualized information, how they guided users, and how they facilitated the insurance process.</p>

            <p>I then helped to make high-fidelity mockups of the interface in Sketch and later was responsible for adding interactions and animations to the prototype in Flinto. As I was creating the mockups, I thought that it was important that we have the content and message planned out for our prototypes as this would get rid of any redundant information that the user does not need and help us to restructure any information that may be misinterpreted or misleading.</p>
            <p>Having the user scenario helped me to empathize with the user and understand the emotions of worry, stress, and frustration they might be feeling during a time of crisis or urgency. Having this at the forefront of my mind when I was making the prototype drove me to help create an experience that would be seamless, informative, and quick to go through.</p>

            <p>I was personally uncertain about going in the direction of an insurance company at the beginning of this project because I thought it would be a daunting subject area to tackle. From working on this proposed mobile application, I have come to realize that my initial feelings are exactly why it is important to make concepts like insurance accessible and non-intimidating. By applying our knowledge of experience design and by presenting insurance in a friendly and emotion-driven manner, this project has challenged me to think more about service design and content strategy as a way of communicating logically and emotionally between the customers, business, and stakeholders.</p>
